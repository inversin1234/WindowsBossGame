- 10 phases with increasing difficulty
- Several enemy types: chaser, fast, zig-zag, rain and laser beams
- Heads-up display showing time, phase, lives and score
- Failure spawns multiple "Fail" windows across the screen

## Building

1. Open `BossWindowGame.csproj` with Visual Studio (tested with VS 2019 or later).
2. Build the project in **Debug** or **Release** configuration.
3. Run the generated `BossWindowGame.exe` from `bin/Debug` or `bin/Release`.

This project targets the classic .NET Framework and needs Windows to run.

## Gameplay

When launched, the game minimizes other windows and starts a 60â€‘second survival challenge. The main window (the boss) bounces horizontally while enemy windows spawn below it and attempt to catch your mouse cursor. If an enemy touches your cursor, you lose a life. Lose all three lives and the screen floods with failure windows. Survive until the timer ends to win!
